<h1>About Us</h1>

<div class="section">

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Our founder, Monkey D Luffy, realized a dream while sailing the ocean. The ability to convert saltwater into clean drinking water could make mother nature's finest resource nearly infinite for all of humanity. After years of trying again and again, a prototype was developed that successfully converted a mere 2 ounces of ocean saltwater into clean, drinkable freshwater. From that prototype, years of refinement led to the creation of our company.</p>
